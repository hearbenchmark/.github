## The Holistic Evaluation of Audio Representations Benchmark

What audio embedding approach generalizes best to a wide range of downstream tasks across a variety of everyday domains without fine-tuning?

The aim of the HEAR benchmark is to develop a general-purpose audio representation that provides a strong basis for learning in a wide variety of tasks and scenarios. HEAR evaluates audio representations using a benchmark suite across a variety of domains, including speech, environmental sound, and music.
